# MovieApp

- Hi there, I built MovieApp by using UIKit framework and MVC design pattern, 

- Popular movies are listed on the main page with CollectionView.

- A TableView with posters and movie names was returned when a user search a movie by its name.

- Movies are listed by genres with TableView and movie details was displayed in a new ViewController when clicking the poster. 

- User can save, delete and reorder their favorite movies, I used UserDefaults structure for adding favorite movies.
- I used Alamofire with the support of Cocoapods to contact Themoviedb API
